# Old English Natural Language Processing

This is my exploration into Natural Language Processing in Old English. There has been very little work done in this field, so I wanted to try it out using basic Artificial Neural Network methods. All of my code is in the Python files Lemmatization.py, PartOfSpeechAnalysis.py, and Utils.py, and my research paper on the exploration is "An Exploration into Natural Language Processing in Old English.pdf".
